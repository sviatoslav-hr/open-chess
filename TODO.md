# TODO

- [ ] En-passant capturing doesn't work.
- [ ] Pawn doesn't auto-promote to queen.
- [ ] Check should force you to make your king safe (block, move king, etc.). You should not be able to do any other move.
- [ ] Pinned to king pieces should not be able to move.
- [ ] On every move calculate all possible moves for every piece to highlight them on a board. (Could also be useful for validation).
- [ ] When doing an illegal move, show a visual feedback why that move is invalid (highlight some squares?)
